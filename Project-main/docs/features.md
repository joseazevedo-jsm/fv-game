## This will be a list of features we want to add, with descibtions of how they should work


**Simulating time**

The time should flow like water, or in this case more like a dam that we can choose to open and close but never rewind (accept for the right price, maybe)
<br><br>

**Life span**

You only life once and this life is not infinite, add a life span (maybe varies or is a set date)
<br><br>

**Diffrent things to buy** (seperate file with ideas)

You can spend your cash on a variety of diffrent things like for example: houses, businesses, life prolonging, etc. 
<br><br>

**Taxes**

You gotta pay the goverment too, but do you really have to? Maybe add so you can not pay takes but at a risk of getting caught.
<br><br>
